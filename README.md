## Notes

- The extension automatically excludes break periods (Winter break, Golden Week, etc.)
- Events are only created for dates within valid class periods
- Each course session is created as a separate event (not a recurring event) for maximum compatibility
- Semester dates are auto-detected from the page, but can be manually adjusted in the extension popup
- Custom semesters can be added by editing the `SEMESTER_DATES` mapping in `popup.js`

## Troubleshooting

**No courses found:**
- Make sure you're on the correct timetable page
- The table should have the ID `ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_uc_registration_result_grv_reg`

**Wrong times:**
- Verify your semester start date is set correctly
- Check if the period format matches the supported formats

**Import issues:**
- Ensure you're using a compatible calendar application
- Try opening the ICS file in a text editor to verify the format

## Technical Details

1. Extracts data from the HTML table using the content script
2. Parses the schedule format to identify days and periods
3. Converts periods to actual time slots
4. Generates ICS format events for each course session
5. Downloads the file through the Chrome downloads API
